\section{System Testing}
While we implemented the operations the task required us to implement, it was important for us to be able to test what we just implemented to make sure it was correct. We did this mostly using the postman tool that the task suggested. The postman tool allowed us to easily paste in a the desired url and choose if we wanted to post/get/put to the specified url. The postman tool was the most useful when testing the post method because it allows us to insert a json representation of a object directly in the body of the request.\\
When we were done implementing the cloud service and started implementing the device network communication the testing consisted more of running the device and manually testing the different functions it should be able to perform. But here we also used the postman tool to test the doGetAccessCode() method, because the testing required us to change the access code, and this as easily done using the postman tool.
