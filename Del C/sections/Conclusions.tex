\section{Conclusions }
The project consisted of implementing a simulated access control device using an Arduino and a Java + Spark based cloud service.\\

We thought the project turned out good. The start code was well written, documented, and easy to work with. Learning how to write code for the Spark framework turned out to be uncomplicated. We both made separate implementations of the Arduino and its code for learning purposes. We also decided to write the report in LaTeX to get a sense of how to use it, having previously only used the math portions of it in a Markdown implementation.\\
We managed all the required given tasks, but did not have time to complete any extras. The overall experience was very insightful and we learned a lot.
