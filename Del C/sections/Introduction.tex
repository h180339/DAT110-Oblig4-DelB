The Arduino design is here:  https://www.tinkercad.com/things/kvRdZLvI430 \\

The system consists of a simple Arduino unit, a Java Spark cloud service providing a REST API to be accessed by IoT devices, and a simulated Arduino in Java. The Arduino unit is programmed to act as a simple access control system. It is unlocked by pressing the right combination of the two input buttons. After being unlocked for a while it will go back to being locked.\\

The cloud service works by providing a message based REST API that enables IoT devices to save access logs and retrieve updated access code information. The device does this by connecting to the cloud service by using the HTTP protocol and sending HTTP GET, or POST requests. The messages it exchanges with the server are all serialized as JSON objects. We used the Spark framework to create simple "servlets" that manage the incoming HTTP requests on the cloud service.\\

The Arduino is connected with a PIR detector, two input buttons, and 3 status LEDs. The design was made and simulated in TinkerCad and Java.
